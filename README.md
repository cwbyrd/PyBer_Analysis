# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview - This analysis takes fare data by city type and ride data by city type and combines the data into a single data set indexed on city type. The purpose is to create a summary of how the data differs by city type, create dataframes, chart out the results, and make recommendations to the leadership at PyBer. 
### In our first deliverable, we are gathering statistical information around total rides and fares for each city type and then get averages fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. The information will be presented in a formatted data frame. 
### In our second deliverable, we are taking the information and presenting total fares by city type in a dataframe and as a line graph. 

## Results
### Deliverable 1 
When collecting and analyzing the data, we see the following from our chart: below
1. The vast majority of rids and drivers come from Urban city types followed by suburban and rural city types. 
2. As the number of rids and drivers increase, there is downward pressure on average fare per rider and average fair per driver. 
3. The vast majority of revenue from fares comes from the urban centers, making up twice the suburban total and ~9 times the amount from rural areas.

### Deliverable 2
1. From the chart and graph below, by week, the trends are fairly consistent with respect to urban city types generating the most revenue from fares. 
2. While there is some volatility in suburban and urban city types, total fares tend to be more consistent than in the rural areas, which show mroe fluctuation week over week.

## Summary/recommendations/Alteratives
1. Based on the information presented above, assuming that there are limited resources with respect to drivers and vehicles, PyBer could look at maximizing revenue by determining the best combination of resources in each city type, and move toward that. 
2. Another alternative would be to invest as much as possible into urban centers, as the vast majority of revenue comes from the urban city types. 
3. Finally, as rural areas are usually in need, PyBer could increase resources in rural areas, as they get more per ride and more per driver in the rural areas.
